## Designing
Drag and drop numbered blocks from the supply onto the grid.

Drag a block out of the grid to return it to the supply.

There is only one of each numbered block.

The blank block can be used as many times as you like.

Double-click a block to cycle its color:
  green > red > yellow > blue and then back to green.

Right-click a block to shift it half a cell in any open direction.

Once shifted, the block can only shift in that same direction again, or be dragged somewhere else.


## Capturing
When you have a design you like, click the "capture" button.

That will put the code of your "scene" onto your clipboard.


## Loading
To load someone else's scene, paste their code into the box and click "load".

## Clearing
Reload the page (CTRL-R) to clear the scene.
